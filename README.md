# Drugs Request Pact

The drugs request microservice provides a full dataset from a retailer that returns some drugs with its correspondant parameters.

##Features

+ Access from the complete database of drugs from such retailer.
+ Quick search from a request of a determined value.

## How would I use the Request microservice?

1. [Clone and run the source code from this repo to get the DB](https://www.github.com/jorgeviz/scrapmex.git)
2. Create a **virtualenv** and install all requirements
3. Run the **byprice.py** file 
4. On the default IP Address http://0.0.0.0:5000/ , the whole database can be consulted on http://0.0.0.0:5000/db 
5. And look for a drug given a certain 'keyword' in http://0.0.0.0:5000/db/'keyword'
